the individual species presence/absence data is too large to upload to github, so is set to be ignored during pushing within this folder

*This folder is ignored by Git versioning* with the exception of this `readme.md` file by the following lines in `.gitignore`

```gitignore
# Ignore contents of private folder, with the exception of its readme file
private/**
!private/readme.md
```
