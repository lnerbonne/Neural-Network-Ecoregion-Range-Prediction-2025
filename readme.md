# Ecosystem and Species Range Prediction Using Neural Networks
### By Lucas Nerbonne 
#### 05/16/25

This project will attempt to recreate the current ranges of individual species and ecosystems using only climate data, trained on a 25km gridded representation of the Unites States and Canada. These models will be then fed hypothetical climate data indicative of a warming climate, predicting the future suitable range of these groups under a warmer climate regime. This analysis assumes that current ranges represent a climate migration stasis; that species have found the enviroment that they are best suited for and are no longer moving.
